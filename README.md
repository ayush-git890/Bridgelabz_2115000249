I have learned through this assignment is:-
1. Static:- for shared values and utility methods to reduce memory usage and avoid redundancy.
2. this:- to avoid ambiguity when initializing attributes.
3. final:- for identifiers or constants that should remain unchanged
4. instanceof:- for safe type-checking and to prevent runtime errors during typecasting.
