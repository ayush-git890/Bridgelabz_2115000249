Day-11 -> Assignment 5 assigned on 27-01-2025 on Java built-in-function and string is completed and submited...
I have learned through this assignment is:-

-> About Built-in function (pre defined function) and String (methods):-
--> in built-in funtion we have two sets:-
    Set-01 --> i have solved problems like basic calculator, factorial , fibonacci series etc using built in function like Math.pow(), Integer.MIN etc...
    Set-02 --> i have solved problem on date and time where i get to known about --> java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter..
---> in String :- i have solved problem using built-in string methods like --> s.length()-for calculate size, s.toUpperCase() etc...

I have learned through this assignement is:

-> About Class and Object:-
--> A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

Day-14 -> 02-02-2025 : Assignment 8 assigned on 31-01-2025 on Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers is completed and submited...
I have learned through this assignment is:-

-> Java Constructor, Instance vs class variable, Access Modifiers...

1. Java Contructor:- I explored the different types of constructors, including default and parameterized constructors, and understood their role in initializing objects.
2. Instance vs. Class Variables:- I learned the distinction between instance variables (specific to each object) and class variables (shared across all instances of a class), and how they are used in object-oriented programming.
3. Access Modifiers:- I gained a solid understanding of access modifiers like private, protected, public, and default, and how they control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

Day-15 -> 04-02-2025 : Assignment 9 aasigned on 03-02-2025 on this, static, final key words and instanceof operator completed and submitted. I have learned through this assignment is:-

Static:- for shared values and utility methods to reduce memory usage and avoid redundancy.
this:- to avoid ambiguity when initializing attributes.
final:- for identifiers or constants that should remain unchanged
instanceof:- for safe type-checking and to prevent runtime errors during typecasting.
