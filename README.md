2. Instance vs. Class Variables:- I learned the distinction between instance variables (specific to each object) and class variables (shared across all instances of a class), and how they are used in object-oriented programming.
3. Access Modifiers:- I gained a solid understanding of access modifiers like private, protected, public, and default, and how they control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

Day-09 -> Assignment 9 aasigned on 03-02-2025 on this, static, final key words and instanceof operator completed and submitted. 
I have learned through this assignment is:-

Static keyword:- for shared values and utility methods to reduce memory usage and avoid redundancy.
this keyword:- to avoid ambiguity when initializing attributes.
final keyword:- for identifiers or constants that should remain unchanged
instanceof keyword:- for safe type-checking and to prevent runtime errors during typecasting.
