Day-13 -> 31-01-2025 : Assignment 7 assigned on 30-01-2025 on Java Class and Object is completed and submitted...

I have learned through this assignement is:

-> About Class and Object:-
--> A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
--> An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity created based on the blueprint provided by the class. An object is created by instantiating a class using the new keyword.
